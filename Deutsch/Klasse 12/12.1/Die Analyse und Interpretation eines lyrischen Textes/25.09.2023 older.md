[Verse 1]
I used to shut my door while my mother screamed in the kitchen
I'd turn the music up, get high and try not to listen
To every little fight 'cause neither one was right

[Pre-Chorus]
I swore I'd never be like them
But I was just a kid back then

[Chorus]
The older I get, the more that I see
My parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
And loving is hard, it don't always work
You just try your best not to get hurt
I used to be mad, but now I know
Sometimes it's better to let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get

[Verse 2]
I used to wonder why, why they could never be happy
I used to close my eyes and pray for a whole 'nother family
Where everything was fine, one that felt like mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I swore I'd never be like them
But I was just a kid back then

The older I get, the more that I see

You just try your best not to get hurt
I used to be m

Sometimes it's better to let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get

[Chorus]
The older I get, the more that I see
My parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
And loving is hard, it don't always work
You just try your best not to get hurt
I used to be mad, but now I know
Sometimes it's better to let someone go
It just hadn't hit me yet
The older I get
