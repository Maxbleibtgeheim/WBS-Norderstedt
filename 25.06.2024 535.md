Act 1, Scene 1

[Thunder and lightning; three witches enter.]    

First Witch

When shall we meet again —

In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch


When the battle's lost, and won.
The battle will be endet at dusk.

Third Witch

There we meet with Macbeth.


All

Fair is foul, and foul is fair.

Hover through the fog and filthy air.

[Exit]

Act 1, Scene 2

[A military camp near Forres. Trumpets sound. Enter King Duncan, his sons Malcolm and Donalbain, Lord Lennox and Attendants. Enter from the other direction a bleeding soldier.]

Duncan

What bloody man is that? 

Malcolm

This is the sergeant a brave and bloody soilder
Tell the king the knowledge of the battle


Sergeant


                                   
The two sides are exhausted and try to stay above.
The Kerns and Gallowglasses join macdonal’s rebellion.
But Fortune is taking Macbeth side. They are all too weak to brave Macbeth
he fixed a traitors head unpon our battelments




Duncan

A worthy gentleman.

Sergeant

Defeating the rebels is comforting like the springtime but
with the comfort seem’d to comes a discomfort swells.
Mark my words, King of scotland , Mark my words
Macbeth surfd us our justic. But the Norwegian Lord try’s to attack us.



Duncan

Didn’t this troubel our  captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

Sergeant

Yes, but Macbeth is fearless like a sparrows.
I must report they were twice as many soldiers as usual.
macbeth and Banquo fought as cannons and with doubels cracks.
and there fight will be remambered for decates to come.




Duncan

So well your words like your honor as do your wounds.
Go get him surgeons.

[The Sergeant is helped off stage.]

Who comes here?

Malcolm

                              The worthy Thane of Ross.

Lennox

 He looks like a man with an incredibel story to tell.

Ross

                                                         God save the king.

Duncan

Where have you come from, worthy thane?

Ross

                                                           From Fife, great king;

Where the Norwegian banners flout the sky

And fan our people cold. 

Norway himself, with terrible numbers,

Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,

The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,

Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,

Confronted him with self-comparisons,

Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,

Curbing his lavish spirit.

Duncan

Great happiness.

Ross

                             — that now Sweno,

now Norway's king craves a peace council.

we refuse him to let him bury his men

untill he retreated to Saint Colme's Inch and gives us

Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

Duncan

Thane of Cawdor shall  no longer deceive

Our interest. Go pronounce his present death,

And greet Macbeth with his new title

Ross

I'll see it done.

Duncan

What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

[Exit]

Act 1, Scene 3

[A wasteland near the royal castle at Fores. Thunder and lightning, enter the three Witches.]



[Drumming offstage]

Third Witch

A drum, a drum.

Macbeth does come.

All

The weird sisters, united travellers of land and sea,

Thus do go about, about,

round and round

to cast the spell, 

do nine times, and wait for him

[Enter Macbeth and Banquo]
Macbeth

~~The wether is arthul and only matched by the devead of our enemy.~

Banquo

How far do you recon we are from Forres?

 [Enter Witches] 

What are these,

So withered and so wild in their attire,

which look as if they are not inhabitants of earth,

And yet they are standing on mother natures ground

[To the witches]

Seeing you, one must wonder whether or not you are humen

[The witches signal for Banquo to be silent]

You seem to understand me,

so I must ask you what are you

Macbeth

Speak, if you can; what are you?

First Witch

All hail Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.

Second Witch

All hail Macbeth. Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.

Third Witch

All hail Macbeth, who shall be king hereafter.

Banquo

[To Macbeth] Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
[to Macbeth] Good sir, why do you seem afraight of words that sound so fair?
Things that do sound so fair? [To Witches] I' the name of truth,

Are ye fantastical, or that indeed

Which outwardly ye show? [to the witches] 
I don’t know if you’r in delution or telling the truth but If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,(if it really is in yuour powers to see which grain will grow oand which will not) then tell me what you future you for me
First Witch

Hail.

Second Witch

Hail.

Third Witch

Hail.

First Witch

Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

Second Witch

Not so happy, yet much happier.

Third Witch

You shall get kings, though you shall be none.

So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.

First Witch

Banquo and Macbeth, all hail.

Macbeth

Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:

By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;

But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,

A prosperous gentleman. And to be king

Stands not within the prospect of belief,

No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence

You owe this strange intelligence, or why

Upon this blasted heath you stop our way

With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

[Witches vanish]

Banquo

The earth has bubbles, as the water has,

And these are of them. Whither are they vanished?

Macbeth

Into the air; and what seemed corporal melted

As breath into the wind. Would they had stayed.

Banquo

Were such things here as we do speak about,

Or have we eaten on the insane root

That takes the reason prisoner?

Macbeth

Your children shall be kings.

Banquo

You shall be king.

Macbeth

And Thane of Cawdor too. Weren’t it so?

Banquo

To the selfsame tune and words. 

[Enter Ross and Angus]

Banquo

Who's here?

Ross

The king has happily received the news about today’s success,

and when he learned about zealous (keen) Macbeth,

he turned out to be quite impressed by you.

Angus

We are sent

To give you from our royal master thanks

Ross

And, for an earnest of a greater honor,

He bade me, from him, call him Thane of Cawdor —

In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,

For it is you.

Banquo

[aside] What, can the devil speak true?

Macbeth

Why call me by someone else's name when the Thane of Cawdor is still wandering among the living(s).


Angus

Indeed, the thane of Cawdor is still alive, but not for long, for he deserves to die as a result of his treason against the king.

Macbeth

[To himself (aside)] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor;

The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus] Thank you for your troubles.

[To Banquo] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,

When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me

Promised no less to them?

Banquo

Those words which called you Thane and promise you the crown sound nice.
Thought you need to be warry (be aware) of them for they are the words of darkness and despair.
They flatter our ego and bring us to betray our self and most beloved ones and bring with them your demise

[To Ross and Angus] Cousins, a word, I beg you.

[Banquo joins Ross and Angus; Macbeth speaks to himself]

Macbeth
[Aside] Those witches story can nether be all good nor fully ill.

[To Ross and Angus] I thank you, gentlemen.

[Aside] If it is of ill intend then why did it promise and then deliver me the title of Thane of Cawdor, and if it is of good nature why then does it ask such a gruesome act from me waiting to be commited.

Banquo

Look, how our partner's rapt.

Macbeth

[Aside] If chance will have me become king, chance might crown me,

Without my intervention.
Banquo

New honors come upon him

Like a royals garments changes.

Macbeth

[Aside] may the future decide what it has to offer,

time and hour runs through the roughest of days.

Banquo

Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

Macbeth

Pardon me, my dull brain was occupied by forgotten thoughts.
Kind gentlemen, your effort today may not be forgotten forever. I look forward to give thanks to Duncan.

[To Banquo] Let us disguse these / those strange evens of todays ecounter heart to heart on a diffrent day.

Banquo

Very gladly.

Macbeth

Till then, enough. Come, friends.

[Exit]

Act 1, Scene 4

[Forres, the royal castle. Trumpets. Enter King Duncan, his sons Malcolm and Donalbain, Lord Lennox and Attendants.]

Duncan

Is the execution done? Haven’t those in commission yet returned?

Malcolm

	My lord, they have not yet returned. But I have spoken with one that saw him die, who die report that he confessed his treasons, and also begged for your highness' pardon.

Duncan

There's no way to find what a person has in mind just by looking at their face.
Cawdor was a gentleman on whom I built an absolute trust.

[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus]

Oh worthiest cousin, I feel guilty for not giving you enough gratitude.

I would like to provide more recognition towards you, but what I can offer is not closely enough to what you deserve.

If only the amount of appreciation you deserve would be lower, then my offerings would be reasonable.

Macbeth


The service and the loyalty I owe you pays itself.

Your duty is to receive our loyalty. At the other hand, our duties are no more than to do everything to protect your love an honor.
Duncan

Welcome hither.I have begun to plant thee, and will laborTo make thee full of growing

[to Banquo]
Noble Banquo,
you deserve as much as Macbeth. Let me bring you close and hold you to my heart.

Banquo

If I grow to greatness, that would benefit us both.

Duncan

All of this makes me tear in joy.
I proclaim to my sons, relatives and thanes, that from now on, my eldest son Malcom, will take my throne why we call him Prince of Cumberland now;
You will not be left alone with gaining new titles, but those who deserve will profit too.

[To Macbeth] From hence we visit your caslte now,

for that you will be drowned with honors.

Macbeth

Any efford towards your wellbeing does not feel like work.
At last, I will step back to be the messenger for those news.

Duncan

My worthy Cawdor.

Macbeth

[Aside] The Prince of Cumberland — because Malcom now is Prince, he is in my way to become king. I would have to cut before him or drop my hopes.
Stars, exstinguish your light such that my evil desires are hidden.

The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be

Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

[Exit]

Duncan

[In the middle of a conversaion with Banquo]
Let's follow him,
Macbeth is going ahead to prepare for our visit.

[Trumpets sound, all exit]

Act 1, Scene 5

[Inverness : Macbeth´s castel .Enter Lady Macbeth alone, with a letter]

They meet me in the day of success, and since learnd for cretain that they have Supernatrul knowleg. I tried to question them but vanished. When i got back the king greeted me as "Than of Gawdor " like the sisters predigtet .
My dear partner , I wanted to tell you this. Don´t ignor the great promised to us. keep it close to your heart and farwell.

Lady Macbeth
You are Thane of Glaims , and Gawdor ,and you will be King yet worry. You are too kind to take the shortes way too power. you dont want to lie or cheat, yet you want power, but your to frightend to take it.

servent enters

Lady Macbeth

Servant
The King is coming tonight
Lady Macbeth
isn´t Macbeth with him. Would Macbeth sent word so i could prepar.

Servant
I beg you pardon, but itś true our Lord is coming

Lady Macbeth
take care of him, He brings great News


Lady Macbeth alone

Lady Macbeth
Come on you spirits that aid thought murder, give me the cruelty I need and free me from regret, so i can accomplish my desire .

Macbeth enters

Lady Macbeth
The great Macbeth of Cawdor , you’ll be greated as both thane and King.
Macbeth
My dearest Love, Duncan will be here tonight

Lady Macbeth
And when dose he leave?

Macbeth
Tomorrow, as he proposed.

Lady Macbeth
My Thane your face betrays you. To deceive all others, you have too do exactly as they do. The King must be taken care of.

Macbeth
We will speak about this Later

Lady Macbeth
keep your head , i take care of the rest.

Act 1, Scene 6

[Outside of Macbeth’s castle]

Duncan
This castle lies buateful in the nature.
The noises and smells building up dream like.

Banquo
The region of Inverness is truly breathtaking, the nature, the animals, the [weite] and their buildings fit together perfectly.

[Enter lady Macbeth]

Duncan
Thank you for welcoming us, I know our short term appearance cost(caused) you a liitle trouble(distress), but i knew you coul welcome us anyway (ausdruck überarbeiten KÖNIG). See it as our honour for you.

Lady Macbeth
All trouble caused by you is fine for us. Your honour is enough for us to take all pain just for your satisfaction.

Duncan
Where is Macbeth the Thane of cawsor. He hoped on arrive before him[Was soll daas bedeuten? He hoped to arrive before us? He hoped on arriving before us? We hoped to arrive before him?], but he was too fast fore us, even though we rode so fast that our horse’s feet were already sore.

Lady Macbeth
We are always at his disposal.[was?] We seethem as a gift from our master and not as our guest.[was?]

Act 1, Scene 7

[Macbeth castle, near the dining hall. Torches indicate that it is evening. Servants carry dishes across the stage on their way to set up for dinner. Enter Macbeth.]

Macbeth

It would be best to get this over with as it is everything. If the assasination would be a net which could collects all the potential consequences, then I would risk the assasination, even though consequences are still following.
Not to forget that those deadly actions do intend others to execute the same (deadly) action to others, but most importantly eventually to the initial actor.

Duncan trusts me twice, as kinsmen and his subject.
Besides this, Duncan is a very honest and pure in what he does.


I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other..

[Enter Lady Macbeth]

You have news?

Lady Macbeth

He is almost done eating supper. Why did you leave?

Macbeth

Did he ask for my presence?

Lady Macbeth

Know you not he has?

Macbeth

I will halt the course of our plan.
He did honor me and I since then gathered golden opinions from all sorts of people.
I should keep this as it is and not throw it aside.

Lady Macbeth

Are you not the real Macbeth from earlyer? Are you ill?
Are you afraid to act what you desire?

*Wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, and live a coward in thine own esteem, letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' like the poor cat i' the adage?

Macbeth

I beg you!
I strive anything to be a man, but this totally is not!

Lady Macbeth

What took over you when you said what you wanted to do?
If you kill Duncan, this would make you something greater than man.
Then, the moment was not perfect back then but you persisted on following the plan. Now the moment is perfect and you retreat.

Macbeth

What if we fail?

Lady Macbeth

We fail?
As long as you keep your courage together we will not fail.
When Duncan is asleep, which will happen soon because of his journey, I will make his chamberlains forget anything that happens then by using wine.
When they drunkenly sleep, Duncan is unguarded and we can do whatever we please.
And later on we can blame them.

Macbeth

Are you sure that making it look like that they did it by using blood on their daggers is enough to convey innocence?

Lady Macbeth

Who would think otherwise when we fill the castle with grief?

Macbeth

I am sure now that we can do this. I will use all of my strengh to accomplish this terrible thing.
Leave and spread friendlyness to hide what we are about to do

[Exit]
