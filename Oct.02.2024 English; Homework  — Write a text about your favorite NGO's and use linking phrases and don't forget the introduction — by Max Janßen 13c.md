Dearest recipients of the now following text, where I'm talking about my favourite non-governmental organization or abbreviated to NGO, 
I welcome you to my presentation of the Wildlife Fund.

First and foremost, I wish to declare the difference between a non-governmental organization (NGO) and a non-profit organization (NPO).

An NGO simply refers to any organization which happens to not be run by the government, many of which, though not all, are indeed non-profit organizations too.

An NPO, on the other hand, refers to an entity which is neither designed nor run to result in a monetary reward for the ones involved in the organization, but rather solely to keep it afloat.

Now that we’ve gotten this behind us, I would like to introduce to you the Wildlife Fund, commonly shortened to WWF. The Wildlife Fund was founded in 1961 in Switzerland. They aim to conserve the variety of wildlife by also reducing the most common threats to the world’s biodiversity. In order to achieve this, they have set six main goals to reach. For one, they wish to create a climate-resilient and zero-carbon world. Furthermore, the Wildlife Fund also has a desire to rebuild food systems to nourish people and nature. Additionally, another commitment of theirs is to protect the world’s most important forests. Moreover, they are keen to protect freshwater resources and landscapes. As their fifth mission, they state their desire to achieve healthy oceans and nature-positive seascapes. And at last, we have their final and probably most well-known objective, to conserve wildlife and wild places.

The Wildlife Fund is active on $85.\overline{714,285} ~ \%$ or approximately $85.714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,714,285,7 \%$ of the world’s continents with $10^{6}$ members in the United States alone. They work together with local communities like cities and counties, of which they work together with at least 350.

The reason I cared to present the Wildlife Fund as my NGO is due to me believing their mission to be admirable. I am of the sense that it is quite essential for us all to help and preserve the world’s diversity in nature. I am convinced that it is the responsibility of everyone of us to do our part to keep this earth a world of diversity.

Yours faithfully
