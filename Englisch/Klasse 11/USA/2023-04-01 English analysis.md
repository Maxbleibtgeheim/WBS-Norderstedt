The poem “Stupid America“, which was written by Abelardo “Lalo” Delgado in 1969, is about the prejudice some americans have against people who have there origin in another country.
The poem is seperated iin three diffrent stanzes which all start whith the same line “stupid america”.
The first stanzas is about a mexican american who is holding a knife to carve christ figuers with it and the americans who are scared of him and think he wants to knife them.
In the first stanzas of the poem there is a contrast and an anaphora in the same two lines: 
”he doent want to knife you
He wants to sit on a beanch” followed by the line 
“and wants to carve christ figuers” Both of the first two lines start with “he” because of which it is an anaphora also the two lines there is a contrast beacause the first line contains the word “doesnt want” and the second one “want”.
These two lines show how wrong the view of the americans about mexican-americans is.
the following line includes a metonomy, christfigures, the christ figuers stand for religions in general ind is soposed to show the simerlareties of the americanes and the mexican-american in the poem.

The second stanzas contains of an allitation as well as of an metaphor/hyperbole.
The allitation is in the tenth and elleventh line.
“He is a poet
Without paper and pencil” “Poet”, ”paper” and ”pencil” all start with a “p”. The allitation is helping the flow of the poem.
The hyperbole/metaphor is in the thirteenths line: ”he will explode” 
Obviously he wont explode because of which it is a metaphor. The litterel meaning is that there will be more and more unrealeased workes of him that will colect over time. But beacuse exploding is prettz extreme it is also a hyperbole. The effect is that it fiels much more extreme and shows how much of a probleme it is.

The last stanzas cntains of several rethorical figuers such as a simile, acontrast and a metaphor.
In line fifteen to sixteen there is a contrast 
“Flunking in math and english
He is a pecasso” the first line shows him as a failure while the second one os showing him as a talented person.
The sixteenth line also contains a simile “he is a pecaso” here he is compered to pecaso while he obveralz isnt actually pecaso.
In line eigtheen to twentz there is a hzperbole>
“With one thousand
Masterpieeces 
Hanging onlz from his mind” athousand is a big number and some people are happz if thez can even create ne masterpiece. Athousend is such an anrealistic number that no one is able to achive. It crates the effect that he is shown a especialz talented.

Over the three stanzeses there is a climax “remember” “hear” and “see” it helps to connect the three parts of the text and gives them a weight.
