You do not need to worry about our sanity or whether we just had a stroke. 

Greetings my dear readers, today we would like to talk with you about a blog entry called “Do emojis and GIFs restrict our language and communication” by the lesser known blogger <i>ElsaBlogger2017</i> released on the 12<sup>th</sup> June 2018 by British Council: LearnEnglish Teens that we read in class recently. The blog entry is about how we enfold our language and whether things like emojis effect it negatively. If you want to take a look of your own at the text, you can find it at the following URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20180702065034/https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/magazine/science-technology/do-emojis-gifs-restrict-our-language-communication and write your opinion in the response section of your preferred social media website.
To begin our blog, we should probably introduce ourselves first. We are a group of high school students who care about the preservation of our language, and thus may be a little biased. We call ourselves “<i>The Corner Students</i>” and you are currently reading the “<i>Corner Blog</i>”. 

First and foremost, we should probably start by giving an overview of the blog entry mentioned before. The author begins by referencing George Orwell's book “<i>Nineteen-Eighty-Four</i>” and its use of the “<i>Newspeak</i>” a language replacing our current way of speaking. In their blog, the author mentions how Adjectives are strictly prohibited and instead are replaced by the totally not adjective like words such as “<i>ungood</i>” or “<i>plus good</i>”. They continue by stating our use of emojis and GIFs, which was described as being obligatory in their messages.
In the second part of the entry, the author wrote about abbreviations like “<i><b>LOL</b></i>” meaning “<i>Laughing out loud</i>” and “<i><b>BRB</b></i>” standing for “<i>be right back</i>”. They followed up with their own opinion about the topic, which we will do as well in just a second. They wrote about how language itself evolves and how we always have used some sort of imagery to depict and describe what we want to say.

We personally are not quite as font of the idea of writing as if we hit our head too hard and using cryptic abbreviations like <i><b>AMA</b></i> (<i>Ask Me Anything</i>), <i><b>FYI</b></i> (<i>For Your Information</i>), <i><b>ICYMI</b></i> (<i>In Case You Missed It</i>) and <i><b>ROFL</b></i> (<i>Rolling On The Floor Laughing</i>) causing you to need a dictionary to understand a simple text message. We do not feel that it is necessary to write like this. In our belief, we think that it is reasonable to assume for all of us to write in a way that everybody knows what you are talking about ant to follow basic spelling and Grammar rules.
No matter how we lock at people writing these days, we just do not understand why they feel the need to ignore basic grammar or spelling concepts. We do understand why one may not always use commas. But that does not explain why we have seen way too often people writing long texts without any punctuation of any sort, making it really hard to read their texts sometimes. 
Furthermore, we do not appreciate the excessive use of emojis. While we do know why people use emojis, they are great when you want to express some emotions in your massages or to use them to convey quick information. But sadly the days of moderate emoji use are long over, and instead it is not uncommon to see people writing messages using over ten emojis in a row without them adding any additional value to the text or are even having any meaning anymore.
Language is something beautiful, and we want to preserve it, but that requires a minimum effort by every one to at least try to write in a better way. We do not demand that every one starts writing like they have a PhD in the English language and stop using abbreviations all together, we do not need a society where every one sounds like Spock or Data. Instead of that, we really want to find the variation in one's language and their uses appropriate.
It can really add a lot of personality to a text when we don't only write like the dictionary dictates it, but rather give it a bit of a personal touch. For the text so far we tried to write as former as possible, but even we don't write like this in private, and so we don't feel the need to keep up this facade any longer and instead want to write more like a normal person would do.

To give you a quick recap of our view on all of this, we don't think that the use of alternative phrases and methods of conveying information, i.e., emojis and GIFs, are bad. We view them as a great medium to support our normal language, but we don't like their over excessive use we see today.
We hope you enjoyed our blog entry about the today's use of language. If you disagree with our opinion, we ask you kindly to please tell us in the comments of your favorite social media platform. 
Until then, have a nice day, and we will be back in the future with another blog entry.

Yours sincerely

The corner students
