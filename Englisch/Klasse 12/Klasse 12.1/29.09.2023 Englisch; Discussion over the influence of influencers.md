Thanks to Influencers, many people do not recive objektive information and stoped to inform themselves about acouring events.
They only get the subbjektive view of one of their influencers and copy their opinion without feeling the need to look up information on ther own. 

Influencers follow their own, not always known, incentives and people do not question those.

Undeclared promotion of product and services.

A wrong assumtion of trust, confidence, and closenes.

The sites are created to be as addictive as possible.

They are no scientist and do not meet or need any qualification.








Only partial, not every buddy is the same and is affected the in the same way.

Can be a good source of information, and even they are biases can be advantageouse if you know about them and can deal with it.

They can entertain you.
