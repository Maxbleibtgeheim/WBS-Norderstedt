young black British women (line -two)
Boyfrind tom (line -two)
Toms racist uncle (line )
Adam, Toms Brother (line seven)
Stephen ??? (Line three)
Viv, tom‘s mother, it is her 60th birthday (line 14)

Line -two and 26
Tom is living in a suburban area

Line 32 and 33
„Interratial dating book“ in correlation to talking about Tom, this leads to the asumtion that her boyfrind is in fakt not black, hence making them an interatcial couple.


Line 34 And 35
In line 34 and 35 she says she isn‘t used to the the „Provincial solince“ indicating that she is probably living in a biger city with a lot of noise. She then continios by folowing up with the statment that swhe need sirens and nois from cars passing by, which further strengthens my point. 





Line 22 „why have you always got to take this so sereus“
brobably not the first time something like this has happened

Line 30
„Why would Tom never stand up for me“
again sounding like a repatetiv accourence.

Line 36 and onward
In this part of the Exerpt her appility to self refect is becomming clear after she asks hersef if it hadn't been better for everybody involfed if she had just suverd silintly
