Dear ms Birkemeyer,
unfortunatlly the class 




Dear students, 
This week is about two famous soliloquies ( Lady Macbeth's and Macbeth's) as well as about the drama's imagery. To kill or not to kill, that is the question. There 5 stages of dealing with that question. Follow the steps. What rages are going on in Macbeth and his wife? 
I expect everyone in class to finish reading the first act. If you speak Macbeth's soliloquy as a starter of Act 1 Scene 7, "If it were done" pronounce it differently and find out about the effects. You can send me some audios, too. 
Hand in what you did this week  by Friday afternoon. I will not accept anything delayed. If you are ill, send me a by your class teacher signed excuse, please. No handing in means 0 points. 
Keep yourself going, please, don't give up! You can do it! 
Ms Birkemeyer
