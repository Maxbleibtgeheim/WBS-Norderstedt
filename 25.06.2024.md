Act 1, Scene 4

[Forres, the royal castle. Trumpets. Enter King Duncan, his sons Malcolm and Donalbain, Lord Lennox and Attendants.]

Duncan: Is the execution done? Haven’t those in commission yet returned?

Malcolm: My lord, they have not yet returned. But I have spoken with one that saw him die, who did report that he confessed his treasons, and also begged for your highness' pardon.

Duncan: There's no way to find what a person has in mind just by looking at their face.

Cawdor was a gentleman on whom I built an absolute trust.

[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus]

Oh worthiest cousin, I feel guilty for not giving you enough gratitude.

I wish I was abble to provide more recognition towards you, but what I can offer is not closely enough to what you deserve.

If only the amount of appreciation you deserve would be lower, then my offerings would be reasonable.

Macbeth: The service and the loyalty I owe you pays itself.

Your duty is to receive our loyalty. At the other hand, our duties are no more than to do everything to protect your love an honor.

Duncan:

[to Banquo]

Noble Banquo,

you deserve as much as Macbeth.

Banquo: If I grow to greatness, that would benefit us both.

Duncan: All of this makes me tear in joy.

I proclaim to my sons, relatives and thanes, that from now on, my eldest son Malcom, will take my throne why we call him Prince of Cumberland now;

You will not be left alone with gaining new titles, but those who deserve will profit too.

[To Macbeth]

From hence we visit your caslte now,

for that you will be drowned with honors.

Macbeth: Any efford towards your wellbeing does not feel like work.

At last, I will step back to be the messenger for those news.

Duncan: My worthy Cawdor.

Macbeth:

[Aside]

The Prince of Cumberland — because Malcom now is Prince, he is in my way to become king. I would have to cut before him or drop my hopes.

Stars, exstinguish your light such that my evil desires are hidden.

[Exit]

Duncan:

[In the middle of a conversaion with Banquo]

Let's follow him,

Macbeth is going ahead to prepare for our visit.

[Trumpets sound, all exit]
