subject presentation regarding the Black Lives Matter movement

Dear Angelo,
I'm writing you regarding your presentation about the Black Lives Matter movement.

The underlying reasons for the Black Lives Matter movement are the fear of police violence against people of color, as well as the wish to set an end to structural discrimination.
Because of the resend events concerning, George Floyd and Jacob Blake, many people want to express their grief and anger, because of which many people participate in the movement.


Best regards
Max Jan√üen
